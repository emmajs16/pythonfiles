# Problem: turn miles in km

# create a varible called miles
miles = eval(input("Enter how many miles:"))
# convert miles into kilometers
kilometers = miles * 1.609
# print the result
print(miles,"miles is equal to", kilometers,"kilometers.")
    
'''def miles_to_km(mile):
    kilometers = mile * 1.609
    print(mile,"miles is equal to", kilometers,"kilometers.")
